# COVID_combat
## Game description
It is a shooting game where a player can move the character with keyboard arrow keys and shoot bullets by pressing and releasing the spacebar key. The character has an image of "Pengu" and the enemies that come down from the screen are the COVID viruses. Before the game is started, the player sets a user ID which will be remembered with the game score. The score and ID will be put into "Ranking.txt" which will be sorted according to the scores and show the Top 4 scores with its ID. In-game, hitting the viruses with bullets will kill the virus and it equals 1 point. If the player collides with the virus, the health points will be decreased. The default game time limit is set to 30 seconds but each time the player kills 10 viruses, an additional 5 seconds will be given. In the game, there are 2 items that the player can eat, heal potion and a mask. Eating a heal potion will increase the decreased health points and the mask item will make the player invulnerable for 5 seconds. The overall score and time are shown on the right top corner of the game screen. There are 2 conditions to end the game, running out of time limit or reaching 0 health points. After the game is finished the player can choose to play the game again, see the ranking status, or quit the game.
